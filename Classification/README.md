# Classification
Classification algorithms and methods aim to
diagnose and predict categorical response variables.

## Logistic regression
Predicts probabilities for binary response variables.
Predictor variables are numeric.

## Naive bayes
Bayes law: `p(y|x) = p(x|y)p(y)/p(x)`.

Example:
* p(y) = I'm sick
* p(x) = Test is positive
* p(y|x) = Test is positive given that I'm sick
* p(x|y) = I'm sick given that test is positive.
