* `plot_ly` function from `plotly` library

## Abline

## Basic Graphics 
Some simple R plots to get started quickly.

## corrplot library 
Create a visual correlation matrix with corrplot library.

## ggplot2 library 
Some simple R plots made with `ggplot2` graphics library to get started quickly.
* Great [cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) for ggplot2 in RStudio web page.
* Use `qplot()` for less detailed plots
* Use `ggplot()` together with additional definitions for more detailed plots
* Define dataset and variable mappings in `ggplot()` base function
* Use geom_ functions with `ggplot()` to actually draw plots. For example `ggplot() + geom_point()`
