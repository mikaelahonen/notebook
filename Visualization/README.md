## 3D Plots 
Examples of 3d plots.
* `3dplot()` function from `rgl` library
* `plot_ly` function from `plotly` library

## Abline
Create simple lines on top of plots:
* A line with intercept and slope
* Horizontal line
* Vertical line

## Basic Graphics 
Some simple R plots to get started quickly.

## `corrplot` library 
Create a visual correlation matrix with corrplot library.

## `ggplot2` library 
Some simple R plots made with `ggplot2` graphics library to get started quickly.
* Great [cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) for ggplot2 in RStudio web page.
* Use `qplot()` for less detailed plots
* Use `ggplot()` together with additional definitions for more detailed plots
* Define dataset and variable mappings in `ggplot()` base function
* Use geom_ functions with `ggplot()` to actually draw plots. For example `ggplot() + geom_point()`

## Graphical Parameters
Use `par()` to set or query graphical parameters.

## Lines
Use `lines()` function to draw lines to a plot.
`lines(x,y)` will draw line to each x and y pair.

## Text in margins
Use `mtext` to add text to plot margins.
