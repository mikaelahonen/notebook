# Basics
Code that is related to R core functionalities.
## Categorical vectors to contingency table
Transform multiple categorical vectors to a single table
with * `table()`.

For example:
* Clear console
* Remove variables

## Create data automatically
Create data automatically by replicating values number of times or
take a number sequence with defined interval lengths.

For example:
* `rep()`
* `seq()`
* `runif()`

##Named num
Methods for named number vectors.
Use `[[]]` notation to remove label from named numbers for example.

## R Commands
Common commands for R and RStudio.

## Round
Difference between functions:
* `ceiling()`
* `floor()`
* `trunc()`
* `round()`
* `signif()`

## Save and load
Save variables and load them as needed.
Might be useful when statistical model is costly to compute and fit.
A use case would be to fit a model once in a while
and load it every time a web server receives a request.
