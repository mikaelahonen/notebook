# Data Mining
Data mining consists of methods for finding
pattern and new insights from data,
whereas regression and classification methods are
meant to diagnose or predict a specific variable.

Data mining is pretty much a synonym for unsupervised learning
as there are no response variables.

## K-means
Clustering algorithm to assign observations to <i>k</i> groups.

Use `kmeans()` function in R.

Algorithm:
1. Pick k centroids randomly.

3. Move centroids to average location of data points.
4. Repeat 1-3 until optimal clusters have been found or
maximum number of iterations has been done.
