the outcome can be only success or fail.

## Chi square test

Use Fisher's test for small sample sizes rather than Chi square.
Chi square calculates approximated results.

## Fisher test
Determine if relationship between two categorical variables exist.
Use Fisher's test for small sample sizes rather than Chi square.
Fisher's test calculates exact results.
