Great [cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) for ggplot2 in RStudio web page.
### Notes ###
* Use `qplot()` for less detailed plots
* Use `ggplot()` together with additional definitions for more detailed plots
* Define dataset and variable mappings in `ggplot()` base function
* Use geom_ functions with `ggplot()` to actually draw plots. For example `ggplot() + geom_point()`
