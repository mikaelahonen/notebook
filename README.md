# Regular Expressions
Regular expressions that I need relatively often.

Regular expressions are used to match 
text patterns. For example:
* Match only selected characters.
* Match a character if it exists.
* Specify only UPPERCASE characters.
* Match the string if it is at the end of line.
* And any combinations of these...

A common use case is to replace text from Notepad++.

## Find all `<p>` and `</p>` tags
### RegEx
`</?p>`
### Expalantion
* `<` Match string "<".
* `/?` Match character "/" if it exists.
* `p>` Match string "p>".
